# GeneXus MCP Capabilities Inventory

This document records the MCP-facing surface that is currently exposed by the repository.

Agent usage reference:
- [`docs/llm_cli_mcp_playbook.md`](llm_cli_mcp_playbook.md)

Status values:
- `active`: implemented and reachable through the current gateway-worker path
- `partial`: implemented but still limited in scope or ergonomics

## Transport

| Capability | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| stdio MCP loop | active | Main local transport for agent clients |
| `/mcp` HTTP endpoint | active | Supports POST, GET (SSE), and DELETE with MCP session headers |
| local bind default | active | Defaults to `127.0.0.1` through config |
| origin validation | partial | Loopback safe by default, configurable allowlist supported |
| session expiration | active | Idle sessions are removed automatically |

## Tools

Source of truth:
- `src/GxMcp.Gateway/tool_definitions.json`

Query notes:
- `genexus_query` supports both the legacy `parent:"FolderName"` filter and the hierarchical `parentPath:"Module/Folder"` filter.
- Prefer `parentPath` whenever the KB contains duplicate folder names under different modules.

Tool response notes (`tools/call` text payload):
- Gateway now enriches worker payloads with AXI-like metadata under `meta`.
- `meta.schemaVersion` currently uses `mcp-axi/1`.
- `meta.tool` identifies the normalized tool name.
- For collection responses, gateway may add `returned`, `total`, `empty`, `hasMore`, and `nextOffset` when enough context is available.
- For truncated responses, gateway sets `meta.truncated=true` and appends an actionable `help` hint.
- For idempotent success (`status=Success` + `details=No change`), gateway adds `noChange=true`.
- For worker timeout budget events, gateway returns a structured payload with `result.isError=true`, `status=Running`, `operationId`, `correlationId`, and `help` follow-up guidance.
- These enrichments are additive and keep existing response fields for backward compatibility.

Optional response-shaping arguments for list-heavy tools:
- `genexus_query` and `genexus_list_objects` accept optional `fields` (array or comma-separated string) for field projection.
- `genexus_query` and `genexus_list_objects` accept optional `axiCompact=true` for compact default projection.
- `meta.fields` is returned when field projection is active.
- `meta.totalByType` may be emitted when result rows expose a `type` field.

## Completion

| Capability | Status | Notes |

| `completion/complete` | active | Supports structured completions for object parts, include fields, and target languages |

## Notifications

| Capability | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `notifications/initialized` | active | Handled as a no-op |
| operation progress notification | active | Emitted through SSE as `notifications/message` with `operationId` and `correlationId` for long-running tools |
| tools list changed notification | active | Emitted through the HTTP SSE session stream |
| resources list changed notification | active | Emitted through the HTTP SSE session stream |
| resource updated notification | active | Emitted through the HTTP SSE session stream |

Operational notes:
- `genexus_lifecycle(action='status'|'result', target='op:<operationId>')` resolves gateway-tracked MCP operations.
- `genexus_lifecycle(action='status', target='gateway:metrics')` returns per-tool p50/p95 and error/timeout/no-change counters.

## Extension integration

| Capability | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| local discovery file `.mcp_config.json` | active | Points to `/mcp` |
| default extension HTTP client | active | Extension runtime speaks MCP directly for discovery, VFS, providers, shadow sync, commands, and webviews |
| dynamic tool discovery in extension | active | Runtime discovery now loads tools, resources, and prompts from `/mcp` and caches the snapshot locally |
| MCP discovery commands in extension | active | Command Palette can inspect discovery, open resources, and run prompts from the cached snapshot |
| global Claude registration | active | Uses HTTP wrapper against `/mcp` |

## Known gaps

- Resource surface is still too small for rich object exploration.
- Prompt catalog is still minimal.
- Completions are currently static and schema-oriented; object-name completion is still pending.
- Prompt workflows now validate required and enumerated arguments in the gateway, but object-name-aware completion is still pending.
- Extension flows already migrated to MCP include discovery, prompts, resources, SQL, tests, build/rebuild, indexing, object creation, attribute rename, procedure extraction, properties, history, and structure/indexes views.
- `genexus_forge` is reachable now, but code generation quality is still early-stage.
