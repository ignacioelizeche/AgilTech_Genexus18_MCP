# Changelog

## 1.1.7 - 2026-04-10

- Added protocol-first LLM bootstrap surfaces:
  - MCP resource `genexus://kb/llm-playbook`
  - MCP prompt `gx_bootstrap_llm` (now supports optional `goal`)
  - AXI CLI command `genexus-mcp llm help`
- Hardened MCP/AXI contract behavior for agent usage:
  - Stable list normalization for array payloads
  - Timeout responses with actionable `operationId` follow-up
  - Additional contract tests for resources/prompts/operation tracking
- Improved tool discovery descriptions for key tools (`query`, `list_objects`, `read`, `edit`, `lifecycle`) with more actionable guidance.
- Added automated LLM contract smoke:
  - `scripts/mcp_llm_contract_smoke.ps1`
  - CI workflow `.github/workflows/ci.yml` running CLI tests, gateway tests, and LLM smoke.
- Packaging hygiene:
  - Added `.npmignore` to exclude runtime logs/transient cache
  - Build now removes transient logs/cache from `publish` output
